        <p>I love food, going to concerts, and playing Tetris.<br>
          My name is Catherine Jade de Leon, but please...</p>
        <h4>Call me Cat.</h4>
        <p>I think I've always been a designer without ever having said it aloud. I was "building" websites in elementary school on Neopets PetPages and it continued on the middle school and high school when I was restyling my Xanga blog and my MySpace page.</p>
        <p><span class="innerDialog">I've aged myself pretty extensively here, haven't I?</span></p>
        <p>Don't get me wrong, "building websites" is in quotes for a reason. The earlier stages were just pasting in GIFs, links, and maybe text marquees if I really wanted to be fancy. Later, it was copying, pasting, and tweaking style sheets to my liking.</p>
        <p>It might have been this familiarity with web language that helped me in college with my introductory computer science courses. While I enjoyed these frustrating courses, I pursued math instead, because at the time, I thought math was the only thing I was equally good at and interested in. By the end of my five years at SJSU, I learned I was very wrong but I was already a year overdue and just wanted to get out of school.</p>
        <p>After graduating, I was sitting on my expensive diploma and a lack of passion. It would be that way for an additional five years, while working jobs that let me do the only thing I liked about math - solving problems - and doing it the only way I know how; by trying to make people's lives easier.</p>
        <p>I wish there was a poetic moment to how I got here, to how I realized everything I've done in the past has culminated to my decision of wanting to pursue design, but the reality is this: my brother, a UX designer, showed me what he does.</p>
        <p><span class="innerDialog">Why aren't I already doing this?</span></p>
        <p>So here I am.</p>

        <p>If you happen to catch me off my laptop, I might be playing tennis, watching a basketball game, singing karaoke, taking pictures with my phone, or befriending your pet. :)</p>

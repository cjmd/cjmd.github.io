However, the client had no clear vision for the product and without a name, branding, and even a target audience, the first step was to do research.</p>

            <p>A survey was conducted to gather information on how users use existing cloud storage services. While only 35 users took the survey, their responses were informative of current products and how they're used.</p>

          <p>When asked what cloud storage is, all participants understand that it's a drive used to store and access content remotely and online.  When asked to provide examples, the participants listed the biggest names in the market: Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, and Box.  Other examples provided were enterprise services like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services.

          <p>The participants who do use cloud storage use them for a variety of reasons as expected.  Of all the auxiliary reasons to use cloud storage, photos had the biggest use, which makes sense in this day and age when taking photos is easily done so we’re taking a LOT of them and need somewhere to store them.
          <br><br>
          Seeing the variety of use cases for cloud storage introduces many directions that this app could take.  Instead of serving multiple purposes and competing with the big names, this app could be geared towards a certain niche.

          After collecting data on which services were used most, competitive analyses were made between them.</p>

            <p>The wireframe and prototype were modeled after existing services so that users would have no problem identifying what to do. This is reflective in the user tests that were conducted.

            These tests provided a lot of feedback for me, like one user's list view suggestion. There were a lot of screens that the "regular users" weren't able to use; that was my lack of direction for them. I should have been more specific with what "organizing content" meant.
            <br><br>
            With that feedback, the user flows and processes were satisfactory and the next step was branding in order to create higher quality mockups.</p>

            <p align=center><img src="../images/cloutstoragecolors.svg" width=100% alt="Color palette: peacy pink, cardboard tan, dusty blue, black, funk purple, and white"></p>
            <br>
            <p>Because this is now geared toward the "influencer," I think the color palette should be a little more feminie, light, and airy but still approachable for everyone.</p>

            <p>Because of the nature of the service, I want the brand typeface to be a script because scripts tend to be more feminine. Using <a href="https://fontpair.co/">Fontpair.co</a>, I tried to see what sans-serif would go best with a script. I want to use a sans-serif font because we're in the digital age and this is a social media app, so I thought sans-serif would be more appropriate. See the font choices below.</p>

            <p>The first versions of my mockups had few screens and, as seen in the dashboard above, had inconsistencies with sizing, spacing, and overall looks to them, as well as UI issues, like back buttons and navigation issues. After that feedback, I was able to create more screens for more processes and implement the recommended feedback. See the improved dashboard below.</p>

            <p>The improved desktop mockups were made into a clickable prototype which was tested using Invision. All three users who tested the prorotype said the app was clear and clean. There was some confusion with the "new," "add," and "upload" buttons as a new user so improvements were needed there. The bulk actions or "Select" tool should be usable and the "sort" button should be usable to see how the pictures can be sorted. Lastly, the dashboard or home should have more context rather than just a "junk drawer" of pictures; albums, memories, or tags at a glance as well as recently uploaded pictures.
            <br><br>
            After the feedback from the user tests, I was able to implement the changes which brought me to the final prototype, which can be seen below.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <br>
            <p>This project was a little daunting to start not only because of the lack of vision and direction given by the client but also because of how saturated the market is that the client was trying to enter. Competing with Dropbox and Google Drive is difficult as is, let alone as a product with no target audience.
            <br><br>
            The research conducted definitely helped, especially when figuring out the direction of the product. However, after the pivot from a generic cloud storage service to a photo storage service, the additional research wasn't conducted for a photo storage service, including competitive analysis for existing products in the same space. If that research were completed, I would have better insight as to which features were necessary and which were extraneous for this product.
            <br><br>
            The feedback I received from external sources has also been really helpful because I tended to get stuck staring at the project without much evolution. Without the right feedback, I would still be trying to create a competitor to big name cloud storage services.
            <br><br>
            If given more time, I would have conducted the extra research on the niche market. I would also have touched more upon the creaiton of documents, for blog posts or post captions, and what collaboration would look like.
            <br><br>
            While I feel like I've improved so much doing this project alone, the biggest takeaway is how much feedback matters. Constantly getting comments from graders, my mentor, and my peers really helped put this project together. Moving forward, I will be sure to gather as much external feedback as I possibly can.</p>
